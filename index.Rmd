#### Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated Icosahedra

icosa (originally εἴκοσι) is greek for twenty, and refers to the icosahedron. 

These grids are often called icospheres, and have an important use in material design, architecture, computer graphics and chemistry. 

## Package descriptions

Employs triangular tessellation to refine icosahedra defined in 3d space. The procedures can be set to provide a grid with a custom resolution. Both the primary triangular and their inverted penta-hexagonal grids are available for implementation. Additional functions are provided to position points (latitude-longitude data) on the grids, to allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.

This is a beta version, and like R, comes with absolutely no warranty.
