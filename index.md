#### Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated Icosahedra

Employs triangular tessellation to refine icosahedra defined in 3d
space. The procedures can be set to provide a grid with a custom
resolution. Both the primary triangular and their inverted
penta-hexagonal grids are available for implementation. Additional
functions are provided to position points (latitude-longitude data) on
the grids, to allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.
