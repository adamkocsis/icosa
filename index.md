#### Triangular and Penta-Hexagonal Grids Based on Tessellated Icosahedra

icosa (originally εἴκοσι) is greek for twenty, and refers to the
icosahedron.

These grids are often called icospheres, and have an important use in
material design, architecture, computer graphics and chemistry.

## Package descriptions

Employs triangular tessellation to refine icosahedra defined in 3d
space. The procedures can be set to provide a grid with a custom
resolution. Both the primary triangular and their inverted
penta-hexagonal grids are available for implementation. Additional
functions are provided to position points (latitude-longitude data) on
the grids, to allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.
