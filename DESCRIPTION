Description: Employs triangular tessellation to refine icosahedra
    defined in 3d space. The procedures can be set to provide a grid with a
    custom resolution. Both the primary triangular and their inverted penta-
    hexagonal grids are available for implementation. Additional functions
    are provided to position points (latitude-longitude data) on the grids,
    to allow 2D and 3D plotting, use raster data and shapefiles.
