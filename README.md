# icosa
R package for global triangular and penta-gexagonal grids based on tessellated icosahedra (v0.10.0)

## News

I initilized the developmental repository of the `icosa` package, which has been under continuous testing in the past year. I have not been attending to this project, as I have been too occupied with research and my other package. 

## About

This repository contains the under development versions of the package as well as those that were uploaded to the CRAN.


## Installation

1. The stable version of the package is openly available from the CRAN servers. Just type in
```
`install.packages("icosa")`
```

and the package will be installed. In case you would like to experiment with the under development versions, please take a look at the points below

2. If you have a compiler installed, you can install the latest version from the source tarball, with
```
install.packages(
  "https://github.com/adamkocsis/icosa/raw/master/_archive/sources/icosa_0.10.0.tar.gz", 
  repos=NULL, type="source")
```
3. I will also provide binaries for Windows. If you want to, you can try them. 
`install.packages("https://github.com/adamkocsis/icosa/raw/master/_bin/Win_x64_x86/icosa_0.10.0.zip", repos=NULL, type="win.binary")`
